               <p> GTA VI map has been sketched.  A group of GTA lovers have dedicated their time to analyzing all the GTA VI videos that have been believed to have leaked. They have been making some good progress and now have some part of the GTA VI map. A similar occasion occurred before the release of GTA V back in “2013” as GTA lovers also sketched a GTA V map similar to that in the game before it was even released.
                It is just so amazing how some people because of the love for a game, put in all their efforts to sketch the map of a game before it is even released.
                Wow! , just wow! Can you even do all that for a game yet you know it will soon be released at some point in time.
                Do you think that their map is mostly accurate or vice versa? Just think about it.</p>

                You cannot pierce car tires using a knife or a sword. You can also race anyone in the game as long as you rev your tires at the lights. 
                Chop will immediately die in case he touches the water. 
                Chop will not fetch the ball in case it touches the water.
                Chop can attack Lamar though he is Chop’s former owner. 
                Chop cannot kill any thing in the game.
                Fire fighters cannot stop a fire on their own truck. 
                Fire fighters cannot catch on fire due to their fire resistant suits.
                A tree can catch fire in the game.  You cannot tow an ATM machine. 
                There is a map somewhere in the game that is said to be the GTA VI map. 
                Those are some of the true myths in GTA V.</p>
